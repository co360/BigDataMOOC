# Tips on Cloudera VM

## Setting up the keyboard layout

You may find that the keyboard layout is not the one you desire. Here's what you have to do to change it:

1. Go to System > Preferences > Keyboard

    ![select_keyboard_settings](_static/select_keyboard_settings.png)

2. Go to the _Layouts_ tab and click _Add_

    ![add_layout](_static/add_layout.png)

3. Browse the layouts by Country or Language to find the one you want and Click _Add_

    ![select_layout](_static/layout_selection.png)

4. Select the layout you have just added and drag it to the top of the Layouts list.

    ![drag_layout](_static/drag_layout.png)

5. Click _Close_ and that's it! 

    ![close_keyboard](_static/close_keyboard.png)
    
## Configure Clipboard and Drag and Drop

If you want to be able to copy-paste from your computer into the VM and vice-versa, as well as dragging files from one side to the other you can:

1. Click on Devices > Drag and Drop > Bidirectional 

    ![drag_drop](_static/DragDrop_bidirectional.png)

2. Click on Devices > Shared Clipboard > Bidirectional

    ![clipboard](_static/clipboard_bidirectional.png)

The menu in your compute may differ slightly from the pictures shown depending on the OS.
